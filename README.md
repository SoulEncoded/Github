## The Problem



## The Essentials

- `git fetch`
- `git pull`
- `git push`
- `git clone`
- `git remote`

## The Challenge
NOTE: If you haven't already create a github account. Make sure to choose a username that you won't mind putting on a resume. It's very common practice for employers ask you about your Github account as it is a great place to see your sample work. Treat it like your portfolio.

Steps:
1. create a new repository
2. clone the repository to a local directory
3. make changes and commit those changes
4. push your changes to the Github
5. create and checkout a new branch
6. make changes to your new branch and commit them
7. push the new branch to the Github
8. In Github create a new pull request merging your new branch back into the master branch
9. If there are any merge issues, resolve the conflict then merge the new branch into the master branch
10. on your local directory, pull the new merged in changes
